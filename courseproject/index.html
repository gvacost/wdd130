            For this reason, I always take the time to evaluate each situation, analyzing what kind of business is, how the competence work and in this way, I can make focus in the specific needs of each client and what is more suitable for them.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <h5>How long will it take to have my project finished?</h5>
            <p>Counting from the moment of the first consultation, going through the process time of understanding the client's requirements, it can take about three to four weeks, depending on the current amount of work at the moment to finish it.</p>
            <h5>How is the budget prepared?</h5>
            <p>It depends on some factors. The amount of content that you want to dump on the website. The time it takes me to investigate how other types of similar pages on the market work. It also depends on the time it takes for the client's feedback to meet all their requirements.
            Once the project is set to start we meet in a virtual interview to understand every requirement and catch every detail and donÂ´t miss any important information.</p>
