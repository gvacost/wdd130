                <h2 class="title1">Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
                <p class="text1">The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine.The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>
